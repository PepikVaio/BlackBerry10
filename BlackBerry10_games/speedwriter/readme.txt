Speed Writer - Text Input/Custom Control

========================================================================
Sample Description.
 
This is a challenging game for testing your typing skills on the virtual keyboard. 
Consequently, one of the things you learn with this sample is how to handle text input. 
The speed is measured using a gauge, which is implemented as a Custom Control.

You will learn how to:
- Create a Custom Control in C++ and add it to a QML document.
- Create a Custom Object for word checking and add it to QML.
- Monitor changes in a TextField and update a TextArea.
